	of the band structure, density of states and the Born effective charge
	tensors for the ferroelectric (ground state B 1a 1) and paraelectric
	(I4/mmm) phases of bismuth titanate. The calculations are done using
	the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) as well as the local
	density approximation (LDA) of the density functional theory. In
	contrast to the literature, our calculations on the B 1a 1 structure
	using GGA and LDA yield smaller indirect bandgaps as compared to
	the direct bandgaps, in agreement with the experimental data. The
	density of states shows considerable hybridization among Ti 3d, Bi
	6p and O 2p states indicating the covalent nature of the bonds leading
	to the ferroelectric instability. The Born effective charge tensors
	of the constituent ions for the ground state (B 1a 1) and paraelectric
	(I4/mmm) structures were calculated using the Berry phase method.
	This is followed by the calculation of the spontaneous polarization
	for the ferroelectric B 1a 1 phase using the Born effective charge
	tensors of the individual ions. The calculated value for the spontaneous
	polarization of ferroelectric bismuth titanate using different Born
	effective charges was found to be in the range of 55 Â± 13 ÂµC cm(
	- 2) in comparison to the reported experimental value of (50 Â± 10
	ÂµC cm( - 2)) for single crystals. The origin of ferroelectricity
	is attributed to the relatively large displacements of those oxygen
	ions in the TiO(6) octahedra that lie along the a axis of the bismuth
	titanate crystal.},

	preoperative level of fear or type of coping and recovery from surgery.
	Results showed a linear relationship between level of preoperative
	fear and recovery, with the least favorable recovery associated with
	high levels of preoperative fear. A significant interaction was found
